Main program

How to run:

Step1:

If python is not installed, install latest Python(x,y) from this location: https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/wiki/Downloads (It comes bundeled with both Numpy and Matplotlib library)

If python already installed Run pip install -r requirements.txt

If Numpy or Matplotlib fails to install, you may need to create a virtual environment and install the Python(x,y)
