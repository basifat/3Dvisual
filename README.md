Set up:

1. If python is not installed, install latest Python(x,y) from this location:
https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/wiki/Downloads
(It comes bundeled with both Numpy and Matplotlib library)

2. If python already installed
Run pip install -r requirements.txt

If Numpy or Matplotlib fails to install, you may need to create a virtual environment and install the Python(x,y)
